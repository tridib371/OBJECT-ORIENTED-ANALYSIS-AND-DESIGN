# üñ•Ô∏è Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)

**Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)** is a software engineering methodology that uses **object-oriented concepts** to analyze, design, and implement software systems. OOAD emphasizes **modularity, reusability, and maintainability** by modeling real-world entities as software objects.

## üìö Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students should be able to:

- Understand **object-oriented concepts** and their application in software design.  
- Create **UML diagrams** to represent software systems.  
- Apply **analysis and design principles** to develop maintainable software.  
- Model real-world problems using **classes, objects, relationships, and interactions**.  
- Use OOAD techniques in **software development lifecycle**.

## üìù Theory Topics

1. **Introduction to OOAD**
   - What is OOAD?  
   - Difference between Object-Oriented and Procedural Analysis  
   - Benefits of OOAD  

2. **Object-Oriented Concepts**
   - Classes and Objects  
   - Attributes and Methods  
   - Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction  
   - Association, Aggregation, Composition  

3. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Gathering and analyzing requirements  
   - Use Case modeling  
   - Functional and non-functional requirements  

4. **System Modeling**
   - Introduction to UML (Unified Modeling Language)  
   - **Static Modeling:** Class Diagrams, Object Diagrams  
   - **Dynamic Modeling:** Use Case Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams, Activity Diagrams, State Diagrams  

5. **Design Principles**
   - SOLID principles  
   - GRASP patterns (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns)  
   - Design Patterns overview (Factory, Singleton, Observer, etc.)  

6. **Software Development Lifecycle**
   - Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Maintenance  
   - Iterative and incremental development using OOAD  

7. **Case Study & System Design**
   - Real-world examples of OOAD  
   - Mapping requirements to design diagrams  
   - Validation and verification of designs

## üìä UML & Other Diagrams

**1. Use Case Diagram**  
- Represents **functional requirements** of a system.  
- Shows **actors**, **use cases**, and their interactions.  
- Example: Online Banking, Library Management System.

**2. Class Diagram**  
- Shows **classes, attributes, methods, and relationships**.  
- Relationships: Association, Aggregation, Composition, Inheritance, Dependency.  

**3. Sequence Diagram**  
- Depicts **object interactions over time**.  
- Shows the sequence of messages exchanged among objects.  

**4. Activity Diagram**  
- Models **workflow or business processes**.  
- Includes decisions, parallel activities, start and end points.  

**5. State Diagram**  
- Represents **state changes** of an object in response to events.  
- Useful for reactive systems (e.g., vending machine states).  

**6. Object Diagram**  
- Shows a **snapshot of objects at a point in time**, their attributes, and links.  

**7. Component & Deployment Diagrams**  
- Component Diagram: Shows software components and their dependencies.  
- Deployment Diagram: Shows **physical architecture**, nodes, and communication paths.

## üñ•Ô∏è Lab & Design Practice

- Use tools like **StarUML, Lucidchart, Visual Paradigm, or draw.io** for UML diagramming.  
- Practice exercises:

| Lab | Task |
|-----|------|
| 1   | Draw a **Use Case Diagram** for a Library Management System. |
| 2   | Create a **Class Diagram** for a Student Information System. |
| 3   | Develop a **Sequence Diagram** for the Login Process. |
| 4   | Design an **Activity Diagram** for Online Shopping Workflow. |
| 5   | Create a **State Diagram** for a Traffic Light System. |
| 6   | Design **Object Diagram** from Class Diagram snapshot. |
| 7   | Component & Deployment Diagrams for a Hospital Management System. |
